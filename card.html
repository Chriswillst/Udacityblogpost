			<p1>Cats first appeared more than 3 million years ago. Cats are extremely sensitive to sound and they can hear audio ranges that humans cannot hear. Cats also see six times better in dim light than humans. They are natural carnivores which is why they have claws and they must have meat to survive.</p1>
